# moodle-local-barebones
A barebones local Moodle plug-in to be used as a template for more functional plug-ins

#### Description ###
This is a minimal functional plug-in which can be used as the basis of more developed plug-ins.
It adds an link to the Course Settings menu and outputs some simple content in a page.

I used the plug-ins below, and associated tutorials, to learn about Moodle plug-ins and to create this one.
The code herin is based on code from these projects.

#### INSTALLATION
Place the userenrols directory in the Moodle site's local directory. Access the notifications admin page to confirm installation. When viewing a course, the instructor will be able to access the plugin from the Course administration menu.
